<ul>
<li>How many stories can we tell with a library, a collection, a document, even just one word?</li>
<li><p>How do we tell digital stories with content?</p></li>
<li><p>Three aspects:</p></li>
<li>There's this joke that if you ever feel like becoming a full time support engineer, just let your family know your job has anything remotely to do with computers. You'll be googling error messages for the rest of your life.</li>
<li>Often, all that technical person is doing is to pick the right documentation for people and teach them what's important. How can the interface become the clever niece and save family tensions?
<ul>
<li>help is no good to people if they don't know 1) how to ask for it? and 2) what the answer means.</li>
<li>Emizar works by doing two things: it provides guidance to the user to help them make their inquiry more precise, and it puts explanatory content beside procedural 'do this, with that'</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sometime we don't want to tell a story with the documents, we want to tell a story about what they say. Two related pieces of work we did over the summer:
<ul>
<li>Detecting Sarcasm on Twitter -- language is about far more than words, especially on social media. There's huge interest in sentiment analysis, but people rarely simply say what they mean.</li>
<li>Topic Mapping the RIA Journals -- using LDA, we looked at the shift of terms and how articles across the decades reflected the chronology of the XIXth Century in Ireland, a fascinating, tumultuous time. We focused on the effects of data cleaning, and analysed how the topics changed -- understanding what the tools are saying is at least as important as the interpretation you get from the results.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What if we have the right content, but it's not in the right form?</li>
<li>In this case we thought, how can we make something different from semi-structured content?
<ul>
<li>Yodle translates from 'sit forward' to 'sit back' content. We build a slide-style format from wikipedia articles, and we change the number and the content of the slides based on what the user already knows and the fact that wikipedia articles are structured and semi-structured (fact about hitting philosophy)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>So what do you do, Alex?
<ul>
<li>for a researchers it's even worse than for a student -- my PhD was about semantic interoperation: linking knowledge bases together. My work now is about content analysis for personalistion and adaptation: How can we create new experiences from large collections and small ones, structured ones and unstructured ones?</li>
<li>Key Technologies:
<ul>
<li>Web</li>
<li>Semantics</li>
<li>Machine Learning</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Key approaches:
<ul>
<li>Data Modelling</li>
<li>Data Cleaning</li>
<li>Content Analysis beyond the keywords</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>What story can we tell together?</p></li>
